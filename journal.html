<h1> This is a the page where i will give updates on the progress of the website
	

</h1>

<h2>Entry 1,</h2>

<p> so far Comp-Sci is going well, it's class three and i am starting to understand how differant code effects certain aspects of the website.
</p>
 
 <h2>Entry 2,</h2>

 <p> Today we learned how to puplish things on our website. </p>
 <p> The first thing you want to do is go into the website folder by using cd/.desktop, then next you want to type " git add . "</p>
 <P> Next you need to actal add the changes by using the code, " git commit -m."(type what you changed)" "</P>
 <p> Finaly you need to send the code to the internet with " git push " this will add the code to the website and in a few minutes all the code will update</p>

 <h2>Entry 3,</h2>

 <P> In this update we made jumpsacres for hallowee, mine was working fine, but still needs some work. I'm hopeing it'll work in this class.</P>
